## 🐍 Python-VolcanoWebmap

- Second example project [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/)
- Uses the folium library to create a Webmap of volcanoes in the United States, with data dynamically populated from a CSV file extracted with Pandas
- Population layer has different coloured polygon maps, and layer control allows you to turn the maps on and off


## 📓 Comments

- Further use of Python libraries demonstrates how versatile they are. The Webmap alone is something that could take weeks or even months to make properly, and yet I was able to get it working in less than an hour
- The styling and the data populated on the volcano markers is not what I would have chosen, followed the course for easiest learning. Will most likely come back and change later


## 💻 Running the app

- Clone this repo to your local machine, navigate to the directory and use ``` python map1.py ```
- From here you can click the volcano icons to see some data about individual volcanoes
- In the top right you can use the layer controls to turn off the layer maps
